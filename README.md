# random-chess-game
A simple demonstration of how to use the [python-chess](https://github.com/niklasf/python-chess) library to generate a completely random game of chess and export the result as a PGN.

I'm mostly just using this to get used to both Python and the python-chess library in order to eventually move on to bigger and better chess projects.

I'm writing this to run on a Raspberry Pi. End goal is to design an always-on low-complexity chess engine which can be played against at any time over the Internet.

[Trello board](https://trello.com/b/ArlCR1fD/raspberry-pi-chess), to keep me honest.
