# random-chess-game
A simple demonstration of how to use the python-chess library to generate a completely random game of chess and export the result as a PGN.

I'm mostly just using this to get used to the library in order to move on to bigger and better chess projects.

I'm writing this to run on a Raspberry Pi. End goal is to design an always-on low-complexity chess engine which can be played against at any time.
