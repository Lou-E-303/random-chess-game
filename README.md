# Intro

A simple demonstration of how to use the [python-chess](https://github.com/niklasf/python-chess) library to generate a game of chess and export the result as a [PGN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Game_Notation).

The 'AI' (I use this term very loosely) plays completely random moves.

A human may also play either or both sides.

# Run

Run `python3 src/main.py`.

You will be prompted to choose whether a human plays White and/or Black.

Upon game completion, the game and result will be recorded in a PGN file.
