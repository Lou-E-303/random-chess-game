# random-chess-game
A simple demonstration of how to use the [python-chess](https://github.com/niklasf/python-chess) library to generate a completely random game of chess and export the result as a [PGN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Game_Notation).

A human may also play either or both sides.

I'm mostly just using this to get used to both Python and the python-chess library in order to eventually move on to bigger and better chess projects.

python-chess docs [here.](https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

[Trello board](https://trello.com/b/ArlCR1fD/raspberry-pi-chess), to keep me honest.
